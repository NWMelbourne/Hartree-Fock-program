# Hartree-Fock-program
Very basic implementation of restricted and unrestricted hartree-fock scf procedure hard-coded for H2 using STO-3G minimal basis set. Written while I was an undergrad
RHF works pretty well, UHF probably needs a better initial guess procedure to converge to a resonable solution consistently.
